        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <p>My early life began in Western New York.  Early on I was captured by language and began to study it more seriously as I aged.  I wanted to learn as many languages as possible.  My French teacher told me the best language school in the country was Middlebury College, and so I applied there for undergraduate.  I graduated 2009 with a major in German and a minor in Religion.  I did other significant coursework in French, Chinese, and Linguistics.</p>
        <p>In 2010 I began to work in research administration at Tufts University.  While there, I began to take courses using tuition remission and by 2015 I graduated with a Masters of Arts in Teaching with a focus on history.  I did not change careers at this time, but I did change employers.</p>
        <p>My friend asked me to apply to a job at Harvard University, and in the fall of 2015 I accepted the new position.  In the course of ten years at Harvard I took many courses through their tuition remission program.  Some courses were focused on linguistics, particularly historical linguistics.  I also took a course on Sumerian, which was an incredible experience.</p>

        <h2>Interest in DGMD E-28</h2>
        <p>I am taking this course as one of the requirements for the Back-End Web certificate and one of the final requirements for my degree coursework.  I am also using web design in my personal and professional life. At work, I have a website that I recently deployed for teaching research administration.  It is run on Wordpress.  I am not able to control the plugins or themes, and so I am restricted to custom CSS and HTML blocks.  I am also excited to use custom HTML in Articulate Rise software to help teach concepts.</p>

        <p>I am the webmaster for the <a href="https://craigen.org/" target="_blank" >Coalition for Responsible AI in Genealogy</a>.  I developed this website using Wordpress.  I was able to leverage my earlier background from the Extension School with the latest technology in AI and create a custom theme.  This experience helped me to understand that I needed to learn more about programming so that I could effectively create web applications.  I have recently begun learning React, and I am very excited by its possibilities.</p>

        <h2>My Favorite Place</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite places is Utah.  I genuinely love the entire state.  We have been there many times, and we will be going again this spring!  This photo is one I took in 2022 of a spring sunrise in Dead Horse Point State Park.</p>

        <h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
        <p>I enjoy dining in many places -- eating out is definitely a pasttime of mine.  Right now I am partial to <a href="https://www.turnpikemarket.com/" target="_blank">Turnpike Market in Billerica.</a></p>
